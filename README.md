# Comprehensive Spatial Methods (CSM)
***Summary:***CSM is a toolbox developed using R to analyze spatially resolved tissue data. To see a demo of CSM capabilities please see associated publication XXX
***Summary:*** NaroNet is an end-to-end interpretable learning method that can be used for the discovery of elements from the tumor microenvironment (phenotypes, cellular neighborhoods, and tissue areas) that have the highest predictive ability to classify subjects into predefined types. NaroNet works without any ROI extraction or patch-level annotation, just needing multiplex images and their corresponding subject-level labels. See our [*paper*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841522000366) for further description of NaroNet.
#Before you proceed
CSM is delivered to users through a script that contains all required functions (CSM VER_X.X.X SOURCE CODE.R)
Examples of use can be found in the CSM VER_X.X.X USER CODE.R script
In the CSM VER_X.X.X the user can find all the required R packages that must be installed before running CSM functions
